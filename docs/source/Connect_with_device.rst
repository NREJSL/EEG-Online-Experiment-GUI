Connect with devices
-----------------------
Any lab-streaming-layer (LSL) or openvibe supported devices are compatible
with our GUI because the data communication module is based on
LSL protocol. I have connected NeuroElectric (NE) system by
their default software, which will be shown below. Other
devices including Gtec Gusbamp and BrainProduct were connected
through Openvibe.

* Open NE software

* Connect with USB

* Load NE protocol and enable LSL output. Note NE protocol
  only controls the channels selected, not to be confused with
  experimental protocol in our GUI.
