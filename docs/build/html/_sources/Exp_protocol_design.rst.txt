--------------------------------

* Open Experimental protocol tab

* Add task.
    #. Enter task name, this is normally the abbreviated version of task
       description which will be saved to event.csv.

    #. Enter task description, this is the task instruction shown for subject,
       make it easy to understand.

    #. Choose image and sound files for this task. Image will show on top
       of Subject view window as another instruction method. Sound will
       play at the beginning of the task to remind participant.

* After adding all new tasks, click Done button. All new tasks are listed
  in the table. Now you can iterate and randomize the order of these tasks
  by entering group number and clicking Randomize button.

* Now all tasks have been added to the table, you could specify time for
  each cue. Randomize checkbox here is used to randomly choose Idle time
  between 1 and 6 seconds.

* Save and load protocol. Current created protocol can be saved to a folder
  for future use. The number of each session could be set by entering a number
  less than total task number in the entry box.
